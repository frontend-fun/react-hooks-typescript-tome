# Chapter 5 - Complex Representations

[&laquo; Return to the Table of Contents](../index.md)

The time has finally come to weave everything together. TypeScript and React Hooks must be joined in order to achieve our true destiny: medium-sized interactive web applications with a beautiful hierarchy of components.

In the first section, we'll look at some more complex examples of state where we have a collection of objects that can be edited, added, and removed.
